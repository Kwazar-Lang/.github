# Kwazar programming language
A high-level statically typed interpreted general-purpose language.

# Examples
```c
printf("Hello world!");
```
```c
int ten = 10;
int five = 5;

int two = ten / five;
printf(two);
```

Some ephemeral code examples that may be implemented in the language were presented here. So far we can't provide any specific code example on Kwazar.

# Conclusion
At the moment, the language is under development, so we cannot fully describe its structure, syntax, capabilities and other parameters so important for the language. However, you can watch the language development process and contribute to the development of the language: join the organization and become a collaborator, together we will make the language better!
